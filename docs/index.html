                <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
                <p>I am Muhammad Ardra Maulana, a first-year Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) BSc student at Nottingham Trent University. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                I have been fixated on programming ever since I  started learning Python by solving Tracy the Turtle puzzles in CodeHS. Since then, I have polished my Python skills, alongside HTML, CSS, and Javascript for website development.</p>
                <p>My career aspirations lie in artificial intelligence, which I believe will be a foundational industry, fundamentally shaping how organisations operate. However, beyond that, I also have an interest in financial technology, and with modern fintech systems becoming increasingly reliant on AI, I believe this degree will build a strong foundation for me to step closer to my goal. Due to the versatility of AI, its skills are highly transferable, and the field is evolving rapidly into different sectors. With my interests lying in both AI and fintech, I strive to develop a versatile skillset while gaining a clearer understanding of where my strengths lie. In the meantime, by using my time during this course
                efficiently, I also plan to narrow the knowledge gap and gain the qualifications and experience needed for fintech careers.</p>
