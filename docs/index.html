                    <br>
                I have been fixated on programming ever since I  started learning Python by solving Tracy the Turtle puzzles in CodeHS. Since then, I have polished my Python skills, alongside HTML, CSS, and Javascript for website development.</p>

                <p>step closer to my goal. I would love to keep my career options broad initially, with options in both AI and fintech. Hence, by using the time during this course efficiently, I also plan to gain the qualifications and achievements</p>
                <p>needed to close the gap for fintech careers.</p>
