        <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> Python</li>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Python is an extremely useful language due to its popularity and versatility. While it is a beginner-friendly language, it can still be used for complex tasks such as game development and data analysis. On top of that, Python has a vast collection of modules ready to be imported, which greatly saves a programmer's time and effort.</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> I showcased my Python proficiency in my COMP10121 programming project, where I implemented file handling using the csv module to process structured data. My project also included error handling, data validation, along with functions and classes that interacted with external files.</p>

            <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> These programming languages are core skills that are essential for building most modern websites. HTML provides the website structure, CSS is responsible for the visual design, and JavaScript enables interactivity and dynamic behaviour.</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> I applied these skills while developing my personal portfolio website. I first acquired this skill by completing a Foundations of Website Development course by Code(Cayman).</p>

        </ul>

        <h2>Soft Skills</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Leadership, Communication, Discipline, Decision-Making, Problem-Solving, Adaptability, Time Management, Confidence-Building, Patience</li>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> These skills are all utilised and essential for teaching others effectively. Coaching requires strong leadership and communication skills, paired with problem-solving to successfully spot the best improvement methods for athletes. Adaptability and decision-making are also crucial in competitive settings, where situations are fast-paced.</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> As a coach in Golden Kick Taekwondo, I regularly coach athletes, providing them with feedback and motivation to help them improve. My teachings have even brought the club to national competitions, winning trophies and medals.</p>

        <h2>Certifications & Courses</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>[Forage] AI in Action Certificate – 2026</li>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This certificate is useful for my degree as it shows I can apply AI concepts in practical, real-life scenarios. It demonstrates my experience with prompt design, evaluating AI outputs, and adjusting them to meet specific business requirements.</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> In future AI roles that I envision myself in, I believe that the skills that I have developed through this course, such as risk assessment, quality assurance, strategic and analytical thinking, will be transferable to everyday tasks in the AI field. These skills will be crucial when assessing the credibility of AI and dealing with the ethical, legal and social concerns that come along with it.</p>
