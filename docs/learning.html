        <h2>My Learning Journey</h2>

        <div class="blog-entry">
            <h3>Careers Fair</h3>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> 22/10/2025</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Careers Fair is an organised event where employers from a wide range of industries come onto campus to meet students and offer their advice. I went to many employer stands and asked about internships, graduate schemes as well as the skills they look for in their employees.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Learnings:</strong> This activity helped me understand what skills and experiences each industry was currently looking for, with each employer giving deep insight into what they require from their workers. For example, the BT Group stand taught me that their cybersecurity roles value Python, Linux familiarity, and basic networking knowledge. However, with Siemens, they emphasised the importance of practical project experience, and asked students if they were doing a placement year. They also liked Python/C++ skills, which helped me refine my development goals. This gave me a clearer sense of direction on what skills I need to develop and how I should tailor my professional portfolio to my desired field of work.</p>
            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> As I reflected on the advice given by each company in the Careers Fair, I decided that I would utilise my time in university as effectively as possible to ensure I stand out among the other graduates.</p>

            <h3>Bletchley Park Trip</h3>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> 31/10/2025</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> I went to Bletchley Park, a historic site representing Britain’s breakthrough in cryptography and the birthplace of modern computers. We visited the museum exhibits, including a new exhibit about AI, learned how codebreakers worked intensely each day during World War II, and learned about the Bombe and Colossus codebreaking machines.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Learnings:</strong> This visit showed me the connection between modern computing and its historical parts. It gave me a clearer understanding of cryptography, which is a core foundation of cybersecurity.</p>
            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Being able to see exhibits that hold such historical significance, as well as seeing how the codebreakers worked tirelessly and with utmost precision inspired me to approach problems confidently and creatively as they did, even with primitive or limited tools at their disposal. This trip has also inspired me to strengthen my foundations and skills in cybersecurity and AI. I plan to achieve this through online courses, internships, as well as seminars to build on my knowledge.</p>

            <h3>Hack-a-Duck Hackathon</h3>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> 31/10/2025-01/11/2025</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The hackathon had many challenges, including university and company challenges. Programmers were grouped in teams and had to solve a predefined task, with the teams judged to have solved the problem most effectively were rewarded with prizes.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Learnings:</strong> Observing a hackathon gave me an understanding of how teams collaborate under pressure, utilising their creativity, problem-solving skills, and time management skills to create projects and applications in time-restricted scenarios. It helped me understand real-world teamwork dynamics and the practical application of programming skills.</p>
            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Witnessing so many talented and driven programmers, I found this exposure to be very valuable for my own development because it shows the level of organisation, communication, and technical thinking expected in fast-paced tech environments, giving me a clear standard of what is expected of me.</p>

            <h3>Volunteering at HoKC Winter Camp</h3>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> 22/12/2025-02/01/2026</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Hack of Kindness Cayman (HoKC) is a non-profit organisation in the Cayman Islands. This organisation held a winter camp for young children aged 5-12, which had many developmental activities such as arts and crafts, self-defense, mindfulness exercises, maths and literacy, and even basic website development.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Learnings:</strong> This activity has helped me develop confidence in leading groups and communicating with a diverse set of people, including the children and the other volunteers. I had to be more patient and able to give constructive guidance. This activity also improved my ability to work cohesively with others as me and the other staff members coordinated with each other to keep the camp sessions running smoothly.</p>
            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This learning will help me in real-life work environments in the future as I believe I will have the adaptability, communication skills, as well as the confidence and teamwork needed to thrive in both individual and group settings.</p>

            <h3>Coaching at Golden Kick Taekwondo</h3>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> 16/12/2025-19/12/2025 & 05/01/2026-08/01/2026</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> On weekdays, from either 16:00-18:00 or 17:00-19:00, I would lead or assist taekwondo classes. I would teach the students poomsae, which is a sequence of moves that represent defensive and attacking techniques. I teach them the proper execution of each technique. I also teach them sparring techniques and supervise drills and exercises during the class.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Learnings:</strong> This develops me professionally as coaching young athletes requires me to be able to communicate clearly and also be able to explain complex techniques into understandable instructions.</p>
            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> These classes demand high responsibility, discipline and confidence, which are all soft skills transferable to any tech role. While I may not plan to take the career path as a sports coach or an athlete, I will always cherish the skills and lessons that I have learned from taekwondo, and I do still love to coach taekwondo. So, I aim to have a career in A.I or the tech industry, while still pursuing taekwondo as a hobby.</p>

            <h3>Tutoring IGCSE Religious Studies</h3>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> 05/01/26-08/01/26</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> I gave the students flashcards for keyword definitions and went through them. I taught them about Christian and Islamic beliefs, as well as humanist views. We went through the mark-scheme together and addressed what examiners look for in the ideal answer, going through PEEE and ABCD paragraphing structures. I tested them using past paper questions and also provided them with summary sheets for each topic section for both Paper 1 and Paper 2. Homework and additional help were also given for the Islam section, which the student found more difficult. The tutoring sessions were 90 minutes each day, giving us enough time to usually complete two sets of a topic and feedback afterwards.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Learnings:</strong> This helped me develop professionally as it strengthened my critical thinking skills. I had to assess the student’s work and conclude what would be the best way to support their learning and help them improve, using decision-making skills. Not only did I analyse which areas they are weak in, but also I needed to find a solution to help strengthen them in these areas. I also learned how to work independently and take responsibility for my actions as I was accountable for someone’s academic progress.</p>
            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I believe this experience will help me in the future during instances where I need to explain ideas clearly. Being creative when finding different ways to explain concepts that align with other people’s logic is a highly desirable trait and shows my ability to adapt. The organisational skills I have gained from this will also show that I am capable of executing work in a timely and professional manner.</p>

            <h3>Forage AI in Action Job Simulation</h3>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> 17/01/2026</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> I had to complete a series of tasks designed by Vista Equity Partners that involved analysing datasets and identifying patterns produced by GenAI to support business decisions. The simulation required me to review information and produce concise insights, as well as communicating my findings clearly to my ‘employer'. Upon reviewing the summaries, I would then find ways to produce findings that were more in line with what my instructions required while also listing the drawbacks and limitations of each prompt</p>
            <p><strong>Key Learnings:</strong> This simulation helped me understand how AI is utilised in real business environments. The online course specifically demonstrated it in a data-driven decision-making scenario. It strengthened my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills. The ability to interpret technical information in a commercial context is also a very desirable skill in the workforce, which was taught in this course.</p>
            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This exposure made me realise how seemingly small differences in instructions and prompts can lead to completely different GenAI outputs. Thus, even having knowledge of how to properly use GenAI to produce a desired output is an important skill. Therefore, this has motivated me to diligently study similar courses, while also reviewing and evaluating my work, especially where AI is used to avoid over-reliance. This ultimately allows me to streamline my workflow for certain tasks.</p>

            <h3>Reflection on Future Development</h3>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> 18/01/2026</p>
            <p><strong>Overall Reflection:</strong> To summarise, my learning experience has been a remarkable journey. Setting foot into university, being exposed to a completely new learning environment, it pushed me to grow independently, no longer did I have guardrails to show me where to go. Instead, my future is now in my own hands. Hence, I realised that it is solely my job to cultivate myself into someone capable and ready to achieve my dream career. Although I admit that the initial weeks were lax and stagnant regarding academic progress, I soon realised my mistake and quickly worked on getting back on track and increasing productivity. To conclude, if I were to describe what I feel about my learning experience so far, it would be that I am grateful for it. </p>
            <p><strong>Future Development:</strong> My goals to improve are quite ambitious and broad. I want to take on any challenge head-on. While I will avoid doing too much that I risk overworking myself, I want to make the most of my time in university, whether that be going to networking events, completing courses, finding part-time jobs or even internship opportunities. Moving forward, I want to expand my portfolio with more practical work and projects, especially those outside of my coursework. I will strive to be more proactive and engage more in events to develop myself into a more well-rounded candidate for tech-related jobs.</p>
