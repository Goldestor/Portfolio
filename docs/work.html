            <h3>Project NCTX</h3>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> I created a command‑line bus ticketing application that allows users to view and purchase tickets and access their purchase history, customers can create new accounts or log in to existing ones, while administrators are able to alter ticket prices.</p>
            <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), File I/O, Exception Handling and Input Validation, Git and GitHub Desktop.</p>
            <p><strong>Links:</strong> <a href="https://olympus.ntu.ac.uk/N1406314/Project_NCTX" target="_blank">GitHub URL</a></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This project shows my ability to utilise File I/O for persistent data storage to create a complete software system. It shows how I applied my problem-solving skills for real-world instance such as ticketing systems.</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> This project was part of my programming coursework, which I worked on mostly at home over the winter break. I also used GitHub Desktop to monitor and track my progress.</p>

            <h3>"Can pyrolysis, hydrometallurgy, and smart grids help achieve sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources by 2030?"</h3>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> A 1,500‑word research report analysing how some technologies can contribute to achieving UN SDG Target 12.2. The report evaluates pyrolysis, hydrometallurgical recycling, renewable energy systems, and smart grids, as well as the ethical, social, and legal barriers to large‑scale adoption.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This report was written to critically assess whether specific technologies can realistically achieve sustainable resource management by 2030.</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> I created this report for my coursework for one of my first-year module in the beginning of 2026.</p>
